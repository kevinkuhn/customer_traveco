Based on this comprehensive case for Travecom's transport forecasting, I would recommend a multi-layered approach combining classical time series methods with modern machine learning techniques. Let me outline the specific approaches and models I'd use:

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Forecasting Approach

### **Model A: Seasonality-Focused Models**

1. **Prophet (Primary Choice)**
   - Excellent for capturing multiple seasonality patterns (weekly, monthly, yearly)
   - Handles holidays and special events well
   - Robust to missing data and outliers
   - Perfect for the 1.2M records/year scale

2. **SARIMAX (Secondary)**
   - Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables
   - Can incorporate branch-specific effects
   - Good for capturing complex seasonal patterns

3. **XGBoost with Time Features**
   - Extract temporal features (month, week, day_of_year, quarter)
   - Can capture non-linear seasonal patterns
   - Handles branch interactions well

### **Model B: Seasonality + Time Decay Models**

1. **Weighted Prophet**
   - Custom loss function with exponential decay weights
   - Weight formula: `w(t) = exp(-Î» * (T - t))` where Î» controls decay rate
   - Recent data gets higher importance

2. **Ensemble with Time-Weighted Training**
   - Combine multiple models with recency weighting
   - Use weighted voting based on time proximity

Here's a Python implementation framework:## ðŸ“Š Additional Recommendations

### **Feature Engineering Strategy**

1. **Temporal Features**
   - Holiday indicators (Swiss holidays)
   - School vacation periods
   - Weather data integration
   - Economic indicators

2. **Branch-Specific Features**
   - Branch Ã— seasonality interactions
   - Product type seasonality (cooled goods summer peak)
   - Regional economic activity

3. **External Factors**
   - Fuel price trends
   - LSVA tax changes
   - Competitor activity indices

### **Model Selection Criteria**

For **Model A (Seasonality)**:
- Prophet as primary due to interpretability
- SARIMAX for statistical rigor
- XGBoost for capturing complex patterns

For **Model B (Time Decay)**:
- Exponential decay with Î» = 0.3-0.5
- Recent year weight ~2x older years
- Validation on 2024 holdout data

### **Validation Strategy**

```python
# Time series cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
for train_idx, val_idx in tscv.split(data):
    train = data.iloc[train_idx]
    val = data.iloc[val_idx]
    # Train and validate models
```

### **Performance Metrics Focus**

1. **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) - Primary metric
2. **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) - For outlier sensitivity
3. **Seasonal MAPE** - Accuracy by month/quarter
4. **Directional Accuracy** - Trend prediction

### **Implementation Timeline**

Week 1-2: Data preparation, EDA, feature engineering
Week 3-4: Model A implementation and tuning
Week 5-6: Model B implementation with decay weights
Week 7: Validation, metrics, visualization
Week 8: Documentation and presentation prep

This approach balances sophistication with interpretability, crucial for board-level presentation while ensuring technical robustness for the 1.2M records scale.
